# How to build and run image viewer
I have tried all my best to not use any platform specific code in this project. So you should be able to build this project on any platform that supports the Qt framework.
 - To build
    - Make sure you have Qt creator and at least Qt version 5.x installed on your system
    - Open ImageViewer.pro in Qt creator
    - Build the project with Ctrl + B

You can run by either:
 - Going into the build directory and running the ImageViewer executable
 - Pressing Ctrl + R inside of Qt creator
 - Or in Qt creator, go to , Menu -> Build -> Run

# How to use image viewer
    
You can either run the program in a directory with the images you would like to view. Or you can run the program in any directory, then go to File -> Open Directory, choose the directory with the images and click open.
Enjoy !
